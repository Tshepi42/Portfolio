# JSON Serializer & Deserializer

A console application built in C# that demonstrates core principles of serialization by converting objects to JSON format and back.

## Features
- **Serialization:** Converts C# object instances into a JSON string.
- **Deserialization:** Parses JSON strings and reconstructs them into C# objects.
- **File I/O:** Writes serialized JSON data to a file and reads from a file for deserialization.
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust try-catch blocks to manage exceptions during file operations and data parsing.

## Technical Overview
This project was a hands-on exploration of:
- The `System.Text.Json` namespace for JSON operations.
- File stream management using `System.IO`.
- Implementing clean, user-friendly console interaction.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project. Follow the console prompts to serialize or deserialize data.

# Neighbourhood WiFi Graph Model

A C# console application that models a WiFi distribution system as a graph, implementing essential algorithms for network analysis and cost optimization.

## Features
- **Graph Representation:** Uses an adjacency matrix to model network connections.
- **Traversal Algorithms:** Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the network.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Generates an MST using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm to find the most cost-effective network layout, minimizing cabling costs.
- **Visualization:** Outputs the adjacency matrix and MST details with calculated total costs.

## Technical Overview
This project strengthened my understanding of:
- Graph theory and its practical applications in networking.
- Algorithm design and analysis (BFS, DFS, MST).
- Object-oriented programming to model complex systems.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Run the application to see the graph representation and algorithm outputs in the console.

# Cardless Service Platform

An Excel VBA application that simulates a basic financial service, allowing users to send and withdraw funds using only a cellphone number and a PIN.

## Features
- **User Interface:** Built using Excel forms for input and message boxes for output.
- **Core Banking Functions:** Simulates "Send Money," "Withdraw," and "Check Balance" operations.
- **Data Validation:** Includes checks for sufficient balances and correct PIN entry.
- **Data Storage:** Uses Excel cells as a simple database to store user phone numbers, PINs, and balances.

## Technical Overview
This project developed my skills in:
- Creating user-friendly interfaces in Excel VBA.
- Writing procedural code to handle business logic.
- Managing and validating user data within constraints.

## How to Run
1. Open the `CardlessService.xlsm` file in Microsoft Excel.
2. Enable macros when prompted.
3. Use the buttons on the sheet to launch the application.

# The Vogue Vault

A semantic HTML website showcasing iconic fashion designers and trends, built to demonstrate foundational front-end web development skills.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML5:** Uses tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better structure and accessibility.
- **Multi-page Navigation:** Simple and intuitive navigation between different pages.
- **Content Layout:** Focused on organizing text and images in a clean, logical manner.

## Technical Overview
This project was an exercise in mastering the basics:
- Writing clean, valid HTML with the use of CSS.
- Structuring a multi-page website.
- Ensuring content is well-organized and accessible.

## How to View
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the website.

# Water Infrastructure Optimization Model

An engineering computing project that automates the calculation of the most cost-effective pipe and tank combination for a community water supply system.

## Features
- **Hydraulic Calculations:** Automates the Swamee-Jain equation to calculate pipe flow and headloss.
- **Storage Simulation:** Computes hourly water balancing to determine required reservoir storage volume.
- **Cost Optimization:** Analyzes combined capital costs for numerous configurations to find the cheapest viable option.
- **Automated Reporting:** Outputs all results to organized Excel worksheets and highlights the optimal solution.

## Technical Overview
This complex project involved:
- Translating engineering formulas into efficient VBA code.
- Handling large data sets and iterative calculations.
- Building an intuitive one-button interface for a complex backend process.

## How to Run
1. Open the `WaterOptimization.xlsm` file in Microsoft Excel.
